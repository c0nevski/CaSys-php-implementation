# CaSys-php-implementation
Cpay.com.mk -> CaSys payment gateway PHP integration

#To test the payment gateway in a local dev environment :
1. - Install xampp/wamp/mamp (a server for local dev)
2. - download the code from this repo
3. - place it in htdocs
4. - Make sure that the casysPHP folder u downloaded from this repo is placed into ur htdocs.
5. - Run your local server
6. - go to http://localhost/casysPHP
( you should be presented with a pay "ПЛАТИ" button, and assuming you edited the parameters in getinfo.php, an iframe should pop under the pay button, that displays the payment from from cpay.com.mk (CaSys)
